# World Life Expectancy EDA Project

Hello, my name is Diego Barajas-Diaz. This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project deals with world life expectancy from the year 2007 to 2022. The project was completed using MySQL to clean and explore the data. During the data exploration I was able to identify multiple correlations related to life expectancy.
