Before starting my data exploration I made changed to the data that was presented. I removed duplicate data, updated missing data and updated blank rows. 

-- Find Duplicates
SELECT country, year, concat(Country, year), count(concat(Country, year))
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
GROUP BY country, year, concat(Country, year)
HAVING count(concat(Country, year)) > 1;

-- Create Row Numbers 
SELECT Row_ID, 
concat(Country, year),
ROW_NUMBER() OVER( PARTITION BY concat(Country, year) ORDER BY concat(Country, year)) as Row_NUM
FROM worldlifeexpectancy;

-- Find Duplicate Row Numbers
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT Row_ID, 
	concat(Country, year),
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER( PARTITION BY concat(Country, year) ORDER BY concat(Country, year)) as Row_NUM
	FROM worldlifeexpectancy) as Row_Table
WHERE Row_Num > 1;

-- Remove Duplicate Row Numbers
DELETE FROM worldlifeexpectancy
WHERE 
	Row_ID IN (
	SELECT Row_ID
FROM (
    SELECT Row_ID, 
	concat(Country, year),
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER( PARTITION BY concat(Country, year) ORDER BY concat(Country, year)) as Row_NUM
	FROM worldlifeexpectancy
    ) as Row_Table
WHERE Row_Num > 1
    );

-- Finding Blank Status 
SELECT *
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
WHERE status = '';

SELECT DISTINCT(status)
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
WHERE status <> '';

SELECT DISTINCT(country)
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
WHERE status = 'Developing';

-- Update Developing Status
UPDATE worldlifeexpectancy t1
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy t2
	on t1.Country = t2.Country
SET t1.Status = 'Developing'
WHERE t1.Status = ''
AND t2.Status <> ''
AND t2.Status = 'Developing';

-- Update Developed Status
UPDATE worldlifeexpectancy t1
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy t2
	on t1.Country = t2.Country
SET t1.Status = 'Developed'
WHERE t1.Status = ''
AND t2.Status <> ''
AND t2.Status = 'Developed';

-- Find Missing Life Expectancy 
SELECT *
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
WHERE Lifeexpectancy = '' ;

-- Find Missing Life Expectancy Using Average of Other Years
SELECT t1.country, t1.year, t1.lifeexpectancy, 
t2.country, t2.year, t2.lifeexpectancy,
t3.country, t3.year, t3.lifeexpectancy,
ROUND((t2.lifeexpectancy + t3.Lifeexpectancy)/2 ,1)  
FROM worldlifeexpectancy t1
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy t2
	ON t1.country = t2.country
    AND t1.year = t2.year -1
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy t3
	ON t1.country = t3.country
    AND t1.year = t3.year +1 
WHERE t1.lifeexpectancy = '';

-- UPDATE Life Expectancy 
UPDATE worldlifeexpectancy t1
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy t2
	ON t1.country = t2.country
    AND t1.year = t2.year -1
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy t3
	ON t1.country = t3.country
    AND t1.year = t3.year +1
SET t1.lifeexpectancy = ROUND((t2.lifeexpectancy + t3.Lifeexpectancy)/2 ,1) 
WHERE t1.lifeexpectancy = '';
